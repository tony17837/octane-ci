.Values.nameOverride typically looks like 'integration' or 'qa'. It gets passed
into helm as a set parameter from CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG which gets the value from
the deploy target being executed at environment.name. See .gitlab-ci.yml for
things marked as stage: deploy

.Release.name comes from the value given to the helm upgrade command. It typically
looks something like project-qa (ie, $PROJECT_NAME-$PROJECT_ENV).

See .gitlab-ci.yml for the helm command in bin/deploy.sh for how this is being
constructed
